# keyboard-hero

## Description
I built this website just for fun. I wanted to make a game for browsers and I searched for some ideas on the Internet. I found this game on Codepen and I liked it, so I decided to recreate it and add my own touch to it. I also learned some new JavaScript stuff.

## Features
I added some features like instructions on how to play the game *(even if it's kinda obvious how to play it)*, the ability to change the colors of the keyboard (I'll add some new palettes in the future) and a bot that plays the game for you.

## Programming languages used
I used HTML, CSS and "standard" JavaScript. I also grouped the CSS and JS files in folders to make everything more organized, and readable for you.

## Team
Just me :)
